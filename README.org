# pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el
A minor mode for Emacs that implements a two-buffer hack to provide continuous
scrolling in pdf-tools

Probably this minor-mode will get updated a few times over the next days, so
keep your eyes on it. This mode works only from Emacs 27 (see [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/27#issuecomment-696237353][here]]). It includes
keybindings to just work also on Spacemacs.

Simply load the file and pdf-tools will start up in continuous scroll mode. You
can then just toggle the mode on and of using =M-x pdf-continuous-scroll-mode=. If
you don't want to start pdf-tools with the minor mode activated then comment out
the hook at the start of =pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el=.

Of course any feedback is welcome (possibly by opening an issue in the repo).
