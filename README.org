# pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el
A minor mode for Emacs that implements a two-buffer hack to provide continuous
scrolling in pdf-tools

Probably this minor-mode will get updated a few times over the next days, so
keep your eyes on it. This mode works only from Emacs 27 (see [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/27#issuecomment-696237353][here]]). It includes
keybindings to just work also on Spacemacs.

Simply load the file then open a file in pdf-tools where you can then just
toggle the mode on and of using =M-x pdf-continuous-scroll-mode=.
If you defer loading of pdf-tools then you can use the lines
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (eval-after-load "pdf-view"
    (require "~/git/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el"))
#+end_src
to defer the loading of the continuoud scroll mode file. If you like to to start
pdf-tools with the minor mode activated then add a hook by placing the following
lines in your dotfile:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook 'pdf-continuous-scroll-mode)
#+end_src 

Of course any feedback is welcome (possibly by opening an issue in the repo).
