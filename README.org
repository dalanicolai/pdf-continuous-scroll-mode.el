* pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el
A minor mode for Emacs that implements a two-buffer hack to provide continuous
scrolling in pdf-tools

[[pdf-continuous-scroll-demo.gif]]

This mode works only from Emacs 27 (see [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/27#issuecomment-696237353][here]]). It includes keybindings to just
work also on Spacemacs.

*Note that (only for linux) the pdf reader that comes with the [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework][Emacs application framework]] provides an arguably even better continuous scrolling experience. It also provides a very fine 'real' browser for Emacs. In short, check it out! It looks (and works) quite awesome...*

To keep this minor-mode updated it is recommended to install it using a [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa#by-recipe][Quelpa
recipe]]. Spacemacs users can install the package (using Quelpa) by adding the
following lines to the list of =additional packages= in their .spacemacs file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (pdf-continuous-scroll-mode :location (recipe
                                         :fetcher github
                                         :repo "dalanicolai/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el"))
#+end_src
Then when you open a file in pdf-tools you can just toggle the mode on and
off using =M-x pdf-continuous-scroll-mode= (or simply press =c=). If you like to start pdf-tools with
the minor mode activated then add a hook by placing the following line in your
dotfile:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook 'pdf-continuous-scroll-mode)
#+end_src 

You can set the scroll step size via the customizable variable
=pdf-continuous-step-size=.

You might like to additionally run =M-x pdf-view-set-slice-from-bounding-box= for some
"super-continuous scroll".

Of course any feedback is welcome (possibly by opening an issue in the repo).

** Comments
   - =pdf-continuous-scroll-mode= often gets confused when switching between buffers.
     It is annoying, but I am not sure if that would be easy to fix
     (maybe I will have a look when I have time, or you are welcome to have a
     look). Anyway, to get rid of the confusion, just re-activate the mode by
     pressing =c c= (also remember when Emacs hangs, control can often be
     regained by pressing =C-g=).
   
   - If you like to scroll using the mouse-wheel then you might want to get rid of the mode-line using ~pdf-cscroll-toggle-mode-line~,
     or in vanilla Emacs you might prefer to just narrow down the mode-line using ~pdf-cscroll-toggle-narrow-mode-line~.
