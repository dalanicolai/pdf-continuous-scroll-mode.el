# pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el
A minor mode for Emacs that implements a two-buffer hack to provide continuous
scrolling in pdf-tools

This mode works only from Emacs 27 (see [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/27#issuecomment-696237353][here]]). It includes keybindings to just
work also on Spacemacs.

Probably this minor-mode will get updated a few times over the next days so keep
your eyes on it, or install it using a [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa#by-recipe][Quelpa recipe]]. Spacemacs users can
install the package (using Quelpa) by adding the following lines to the list of
=additional packages= in their .spacemacs file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (pdf-continuous-scroll-mode :location (recipe
                                         :fetcher github
                                         :repo "dalanicolai/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el"))
#+end_src
Subsequently load the file or add the following lines to your dotfile:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'pdf-view
    (require 'pdf-continuous-scroll-mode))
#+end_src
Then when you open a file in pdf-tools you can just toggle the mode on and
of using =M-x pdf-continuous-scroll-mode=. If you like to to start pdf-tools with
the minor mode activated then add a hook by placing the following lines in your
dotfile:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook 'pdf-continuous-scroll-mode)
#+end_src 

Of course any feedback is welcome (possibly by opening an issue in the repo).

** Comments
   If you like to scroll using the mouse-wheel then you might want to get rid of
   the mode-line using ~pdf-cscroll-toggle-mode-line~, or in vanilla Emacs you
   might prefer to just narrow down the mode-line using
   ~pdf-cscroll-toggle-narrow-mode-line~.
